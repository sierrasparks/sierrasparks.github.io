I am an Engineering Science DPhil (PhD) student at the Institute of Biomedical Engienering at the University of Oxford, and an Engineer-in-Training and a recent graduate from Dalhousie University’s electrical engineering co-operative education program. I am pursuing my DPhil under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Bulte within the Biomedical Image Analysis cluster, and my research focuses on investigating the pupillary light response as a potential diagnostic tool to measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to identify early indicators of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, using MRI and machine learning analytics to assess the results. To do this, I am currently designing and employing experimental methods to collect pupillometry, physiological, lifestyle, genetic, and transcranial doppler ultrasound and MRI data from volunteers, to investigate the intersection of Alzheimer's disease risk factors, cerebrovascular reactivity, and pupillometry. I am always up for a new challenge, and am an enthusiastic and ambitious leader who takes pride in my involvement within my university, through several Presidential and VP roles in various engineering societies and in holding EDI-focused positions. I am currently the Equality and Diversity Officer for the Keble College Middle Common Room, and am the President of the Keble College Boat Club.
I am interested in anything that is fast-paced and that allows for creative and innovative thinking - specifically in biomedical engineering research and development relating to imaging and signal processing. I have collected over a year of engineering work experience in the fields of medical imaging and medical tech development, software development and testing, and in wired and wireless communications. I am always looking for new experiences, and to learn new things.
Aside from work and extra curricular involvements, I enjoy playing and listening to music, rowing, and am a major baseball fan (go Toronto Blue Jays!).

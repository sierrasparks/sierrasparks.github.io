Since Fall 2023, I have been a tutor (teaching assistant) for the B17: Biomechanics course in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, where I have planned and organized tutorials for groups of 4 students throughout the year. This course is a technical elective for third year engineering undergraduate students, which broadly covers the following topics:
* Structure, function, and mechanical properties of bone, muscle, articular cartilage, tendon and ligament, along with measurement methods, clinical applications, and mathematical models
* Description, measurement, and quantification of the kinematics and kinetics of human motion
* Biomedical Fluid Mechanics, including in the cardiovascular system and other fluid systems in the body

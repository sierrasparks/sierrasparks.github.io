For two semesters (Fall 2017 and Fall 2018), I was a teaching assistant for the ENGM1081: Computer Programming course in the Department of Engineering Mathematics at Dalhousie University, where I marked tests on a biweekly basis. This course is a mandatory course for first year undergraduate engineering students, which broadly covers fundamental programming principles including:
* Flow control
* Modularity
* Structured programming

The course is taught using the C language to solve engineering problems.

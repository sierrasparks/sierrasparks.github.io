For two semesters (Winter 2020 and Winter 2021), I was a teaching assistant for the ENGM2022: Differential Equations course in the Department of Engineering Mathematics at Dalhousie University, where I marked assignments and tests on a weekly basis and assisted with course moderation in an online environment. This course is a mandatory course for second year undergraduate engineering students, which broadly covers the following topics:
* First order linear and non-linear diffferential equations
* Differential equations of higher ordr with constant coefficients
* Application to Engineering problems
* Laplace transforms
* Periodic functions
* Applications of Laplace transforms to linear systems
* Fourier Series
* The line spectrum

From Fall 2021 until Summer 2023, I was a tutor (teaching assistant) for the B15: Control Systems course in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, where I have planned and organized tutorials for groups of 4 students throughout the year. Additionally, in 2022, I was a laboratory demonstrator, where I assisted students with the completion of their 5-hour laboratory. This course is a technical elective for third year engineering undergraduate students, which broadly covers the following topics:
* Linear Dynamic Systems
* Optimal Control
* Limits on Controller Performance
This course uses MATLAB for modelling the systems.

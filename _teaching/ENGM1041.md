For the Winter 2018 semester, I was a teaching assistant for the ENGM1041: Applied Linear Algebra course in the Department of Engineering Mathematics at Dalhousie University, where I marked tests on a biweekly basis. This course is a mandatory course for first year undergraduate engineering students, which broadly covers the following topics:
* Geometric vectors in three dimensions
* Dot product
* Cross product
* Lines and planes
* Complex numbers
* Systems of linear equations
* Matrix algebra
* Matrix inverse
* Determinants
* Cramer's rule
* Introduction to vector spaces
* Linear independence and bases
* Rank
* Linear transformations
* Orthogonality and applications
* Gram-Schmidt algorithm
* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
